	<h2> Topic 02</h2>
	<h3> h1,h2... tags, BR tag,HR tag, attribute, Pre tag, B tag, i tag , em tag, u tag, mark tag</h3>
	
	We learn using h1,h2.....h6 tags to present headings of different size and p tag to present paragraph in website. We also learn "br" tag to 
	create break in the paragraph.<br> <br><br>This is an example of br tag. It is a single tag. br tag basically works as the Enter key.<br>
	Another Single tag is hr tag which is used to draw a horizontal line.<hr> 
	If we want to modify the properties of a tag we can use attributes. Attributes should be written in starting tag by using a space.For example, 
	if we want to modify the upper horizontal line then we can use the hr tag in following way: <br>
	starting tag name="value"
	<hr width="50%" align="left">
	If we want to write a poem we have to use pre tag. 
	<pre>
		"Time will say nothing but I told you so,
		Time only knows the price we have to pay;
		If I could tell you I would let you know.
		If we should weep when clowns put on their show,
		If we should stumble when musicians play,
		Time will say nothing but I told you so.
	</pre>
	<b>Nested Tag</b> are those tags which used <b>inside</b> another tag.For example <b> BOLD TAG</b>.
	<h2> DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOLD & STRONG TAG </h2>
	The <em>main</em> difference between these two tag is that the strong tag semantically emphasizes on the important word or section of words while 
	 the bold tag is just offset text <mark><u><i>conventionally styled in <strong>bold</strong>.</i></u></mark>
	 the bold tag is just offset text <mark><u><i>conventionally styled in <strong>bold</strong>.</i></u></mark>
